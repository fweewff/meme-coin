# AI-Tuner Technical Skeleton

This repository contains the initial project skeleton for the AI-Tuner platform, featuring a Flutter mobile client and FastAPI backend designed with clean architecture principles.

## Project Layout

- `mobile/`: Flutter mobile application skeleton (BLE manager, navigation, DI).
- `backend/`: FastAPI backend skeleton (API endpoints, services, configuration).

Refer to the respective README files within each directory for setup instructions and security considerations.

## Next Steps

- Configure CI/CD pipelines for linting, type checking, and automated testing.
- Implement authentication and authorization across mobile and backend components.
- Define AI processing workflow and integrate with the backend service layer.
